# Battleship

**Battleship** is a recreation of the classic board game "Battleship."
Originally I created the game to be text-based, but work is currently being done to add a GUI. The GUI is created using the Java package Swing. Battleship.java is currently the starting file that would run the game as text-based, and if SwingBoard.java is run, it will show the beginning work of the game through a GUI.


Time spent so far: 20 hours
